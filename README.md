## NextAuth Session Undefined After getServerSideProps

This repository demonstrates a common issue with NextAuth and Next.js 15 where the session object, correctly fetched and returned by `getServerSideProps`, becomes undefined within the component itself.  The console log within `getServerSideProps` shows the session object is populated, suggesting the issue lies in data passing or component lifecycle.

The problem occurs specifically when navigating to the `/about` page, which is protected by NextAuth authentication.  While the login process works perfectly, the session data doesn't seem to be correctly passed to the component for rendering.

The solution is provided in `aboutSolution.js` and addresses this issue.
